ECE1528 Project Timeline

Part breakdown:

Hardware:
Weight Sensor 1 (weight food)
Weight food → send to cloud
If food has a weight less than 1kg → notify user to add food
Weight Sensor 2 (weight cat)
Weight cat → send weight data to cloud → cloud determine what animal → send data to stepper motor control (counter++, steps)
LCD Display
Get status from cloud → Display feeding status & time
Status
Pet Binding
Dispancing
Finished
Food empty
Weight detected!
Stepper Motor Control
Get enable & amount from cloud → Dispense amount of food based on counter
On finish -> change LCD display + Send signal to cloud for logging purpose (dispense complete)
Software:
Web dashboard
1. Pet Binding
PetBinding (Enable weight sensor) → LCD display Pet Binding state
Auto populate 3.1kg
weight
“Cat” manual
name
Container ID
1

Submit (disable weight sensor, LCD display: Binding complete),
CreatePet (name, containerID, weight) -> write to database
(Binding → enable weight detect, finish → disable weight detect)
2. Set schedule: user enter time and amount of food 
Container1
SetSchedule(containerID, scheduleTime, amount) -> write to database
Container2
SetSchedule(containerID, scheduleTime, amount)
3. Trigger feeding
Check_and_trigger_feeding: (cloud function)
Runs every minute (or at a defined interval).
Queries the database for schedules matching the current time.
Sends a “feed” signal to the hardware (enable weight sensor)
arg[LCD:“Ready”, Motor{id: 1, enable: true, amount: 1, status: not ready}, weight: enable: true}
4. Manual trigger
TriggerManualFeeding→send signal to hardware
5. ViewLogs
RetrieveLogs
GetAnimalByWeight(weight) -> animalType
Cloud database

Table:
Animal
Name
animalType (container ID)
Weight
Food portion
Food level
Log entry
Dispense time 
Food portion
Remain food level


Message:
Arg [LCD: {message: int}, motor: {id: int, enable: bool, amount: int}, weight: {enable: bool}]
Arg[LCD: {message: “Finished”}, motor: {id: 1, enable: true, amount: 1, status: int}, weight: {enable: true}]] 


Binding → enable weight detect, finish → disable weight detect
Feeding time → enable weight detect, Out of Feeding time → disable weight detect

Tool:
ReactJS, C, PostgresSQL
